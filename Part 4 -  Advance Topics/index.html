    // First we create an object using..
    // XMLHttpRequest() => We can send and recieve data using this request. Now this is a class so we use new keyword along with XMLHttpRequest()
    const requestURL = "https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary";
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", requestURL); // Now here we have opened this request..but to make it work..we have to call this method..
    // We do this by using send method..
    // NOw here the states keep changing..
    // Now if we wanna keep track of this state change..we can do this..
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () { // This function will keep track of the state change
      console.log(xhr.readyState); // Here we are getting 3 states..2,3,4
      // so we will display data for a particular state - 
      if(xhr.readyState === 4) {
        // const data = (this.responseText); // We have to use this keyword for current context..So whenever we talk about current context we have to apply this keyword
        // console.log(data.followers);  // THis is a string datatype
        // whenever we get data back from server..it is in the form of string
        // So for conversion we use JSON.parse() => Converts JSON String into javascript Object..
        const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); // get JS Object
        console.log(data.followers);
      }
    };

    // Assignment - 

    // From object -> Get Photo url..followers and make a card..so when user clicks on button..u get this following data..!!
    xhr.send();

<!--   v8 Engine -> Gives Debugging tools, API's access etc. So console.log() is also always becoz of this only -->
